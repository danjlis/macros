Here is where I fo the simulation stuff...

hcal_config holds information on geometry and the number of events, set to -1 to use the visualization.

  root l Fun4All_G4_sPHENIX.C
  .L DisplayOn.C
  PHG4Reco *g4 = DisplayOn();
  Fun4AllServer *se = Fun4AllServer::instance();	
  se->run(#) // run a certain amount of runs
  
  change the vision like g4->ApplyCommand();

  to see it all do g4->ApplyCommand("/vis/viewer/rebuild");
   
the outputs get put into the hcal_output directory
If you are running the whole detector, run the trigger
If its one sector, run the hcal_sim_data.C macro. use the simulated energy
